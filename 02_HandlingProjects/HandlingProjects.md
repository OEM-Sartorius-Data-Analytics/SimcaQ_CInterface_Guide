# Handling SIMCA projects

A crucial step in almost any SIMCA-Q application will consist in handling SIMCA projects. Examples include opening and saving the project, accessing datasets or models within the project, etc. For this purpose, the C interface of SIMCA-Q offers a C structure reference, *SQ_Project*, to handle SIMCA projects/files as well as several functions, defined in *SQProject.h*, to retrieve information on the project as well as other SIMCA-Q structure references like e.g., SQ_Dataset, SQ_Models, etc.
